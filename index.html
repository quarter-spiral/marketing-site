          <h2>But why?</h2>
          <p>We decided to call it quits after we failed to garner sufficient traction with Enhanced Wars during its early development. We feel passionate about games and want to deliver nothing short of great experiences.</p>
          <p>We are especially grateful for the support our backers were ready to give and for the small and dedicated community of players that enjoyed the early demo.</p>
          <p>We were looking forward to seeing it through with you but the overall numbers just did not add up and we would not have been able to deliver the kind of game you deserve.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for what has been a great ride while it lasted.</p>
